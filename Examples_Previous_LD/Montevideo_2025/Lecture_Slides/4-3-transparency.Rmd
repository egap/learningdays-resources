## What do we mean by "transparency" in research?

Part of the research process includes: sharing data, sharing designs, sharing
analysis plans, sharing deviations from plans.

Share with whom?

 - The public
 - Other researchers
 - Policy makers and other decision makers
 - Political actors
 - **Your future self** [@bowers2016future]

## Why transparency?

 - Makes it easier for people to interpret your results.
    - Makes it easier to for you to justify your choices about: design, analysis, interpretation.
 - Makes the investigator accountable to a community (or communities).
 - Make **future you** happier with **present you** [@bowers2016future]

## How transparency?

 - Share designs and analysis plans on the [EGAP Registry](https://egap.org/registry/) or other registry.
 - Follow best practices for using code to change the world:
   - @bowers2016future and [10 Things To Know about Project Workflow](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-project-workflow/)^[see also [some of the opinionated guide about using LaTeX](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-writing-in-latex/)].
      - for example share your code on Github (see [the repository for the @rabb2022pnas](https://github.com/thepolicylab/COVID-VaccinesSocialNorms) or the [repository for the @rabb2022nature](https://github.com/thepolicylab/COVID-SMSExperiment)).
   - See the [OES Project Process](https://oes.gsa.gov/projectprocess/) for how a **team** does transparency.
